# Statement from the creator of this DiscordChatExporter fork.

Isn't it ironic that the original repo had a "Fuck Russia" badge? It completely violates the [Github Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct) with the null empathy towards Russian users using, contributing or editing this codebase (the repo). 

### A community project cannot be political, because **the political opinions of any of its contributors is both unnecessary and harmful to the integrity of the project** [see Github's Terms of Service, especially the Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines)
