# Statement from the creator of this DiscordChatExporter fork.

Isn't it ironic that the original repo had a "Fuck Russia" badge? It completely violates the [Github Code of Conduct](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-code-of-conduct) with the null empathy towards Russian users using, contributing or editing this codebase (the repo). 

### A community project cannot be political, because **the political opinions of any of its contributors is both unnecessary and harmful to the integrity of the project** [see Github's Terms of Service, especially the Community Guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines)

<b>Consider creating your own blog with your political ideas,  Oleksii Holub, alias [Tyrrrz](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/), instead of smearing them wherever you go onto whoever reads, uses or contributes to your projects in Github.</b>

We, as the users of this platform called Github, are not expected to endorse your political ideas, because you live in Ukraine and your work is plagued with [a large amount of political statements](https://github.com/search?q=owner%3ATyrrrz%20political&type=code), which you can keep to yourself or, instead of tainting these projects with Ukrainian-approved echo chambers, say these ideas in a personal blog or community **outside of Github**, where people aren't expected to **condone and agree to your opinions**.

By the way, if anyone is asking, I won't promote my political ideology in this statement, because Politics as a whole is more than just emotions or ideologies. I, CyberCoral, have my opinions about the Russo-Ukrainian war and about Russia, but I will not make you, the user that is reading this Readme, agree with me. If you want to know about my opinions, we can talk on [Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/401513599849201684), but remember:

# My opinion.
- Be respectful towards each other -including me, CyberCoral, of course-.
- Have empathy, or try to have it, towards your peers and people who don't share your beliefs, opinions, moral code or whatever you don't share with them.
- Do not condone ideas, ideologies or beliefs that stop people to have empathy towards their neighbor. 
- Put effort into making a better world by spreading this message, because nowadays both prejudice and hate are being spread by people who, unintentionally or on purpose, don't know that hate breeds hate, and hate bypasses mediums (digital to real life, or viceversa). 

Hate, when uncontained and celebrated, can replicate itself in anyone who accepts it and anyone who is not empathetic towards others (by, for example, creating a repo with Ukrainian propaganda. Let's be honest, any state or country can create propaganda, including Ukraine) and people might not know what is the extent of their actions. Please, be empathetic to them and to all your neighbors, even when you disagree with them or when they hate you, because if you stop hate by not hating, you're doing the world a favor.
